### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational Database Management System (DBMS) that supports both relational (SQL) and non-relational(JSON) queries while also offering compatibility with a wide range of programming languages including Python, C/C++, Java, Node.js, and Ruby.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
SQL is a query language while PostgreSQL is the software that uses that language.

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?
Enter a modified version of the following command in your terminal, **psql -d database_name -U username** 

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?
The 'HAVING' Clause can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements to filter records from groups based on the specified condition whereas the 'WHERE' Clause can only be used with SELECT statements to filter records from a _table_ based on the specified condition. Also, the 'WHERE' Clause is used **before** the 'GROUP BY' Clause but the 'HAVING' Clause is used **after** 'GROUP BY' Clause.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?
The 'INNER' join returns the intersection or common rows between two tables while the 'OUTER' join returns the union or both the matched rows and unmatched rows between two tables.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?
A 'LEFT OUTER' Join retrieves all the rows from both the tables which satisfy the join condition along with the unmatched rows of the left table. However, the 'RIGHT OUTER' Join retrieves all the rows from both the tables which satisfy the join condition along with the unmatched rows of the right table.

- What is an ORM? What do they do?
ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to use the object-oriented paradigm of their chosen programming language to interact with their database. ORMs work by mapping the objects in your code to the tables in your database. This mapping is done automatically by the ORM library, which translates the object-oriented operations into SQL queries that the database can understand. This abstraction layer between the object-oriented code and the relational database allows developers to work with data in a more intuitive and language-specific way, without needing to write SQL code directly.



- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
  

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that tricks an authenticated user into executing unwanted actions on a web application that is currently authenticated. CSRF attacks target functionality that causes a state change on the server. They can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the victim, such as changing either the victim’s email address or password or purchasing something, potentially compromising their data or account.

The CSRF token is meant to protect web applications from CSRF attacks. A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. This token is used to verify the authenticity of requests made by a user. When a user submits a form or makes a request that involves a state-changing operation, the request must include the CSRF token. The server then checks the token to ensure it matches the one it issued, confirming the request’s legitimacy. This mechanism makes it difficult for attackers to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim, as they have no way of predicting the correct value for the CSRF token.

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
The purpose of form.hidden_tag() in Flask-WTF is to generate a hidden field that includes a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token. This token is used to protect the form against CSRF attacks. To have the form protected, you need to include this hidden field and ensure that the SECRET_KEY variable is defined in the Flask configuration. Flask-WTF handles the rest, ensuring that the form is protected against CSRF attacks by validating the CSRF token upon form submission.
